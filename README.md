# Wwwision.CrTest

Simple (and WIP) package for evaluating an event sourced Neos Content Repository based on Neos.Cqrs# Wwwision.Users

## Setup

1. Install via git or composer
2. Make sure that the Neos.Cqrs package is installed
3. Set up some fixture workspaces/nodes with the `./flow setup:fixture` command
4. head your browser to http://localhost/nodes

From there you can add new nodes (in relation to the fixture site node).
Changes can be published and discarded.
Moving of nodes is not yet implemented.
